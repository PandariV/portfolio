        <p><b>Conway's Game of Life is a simple simulation for population expansion<br><br>

            Controls:</b><br>
            - Mouse press to reset the board <br>
            - Squares at the start have a random state determined<br><br>

            <b>Rules (from Wikipedia):</b><br>
            
            1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies (referred to as underpopulation or exposure)<br>
            2. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies (referred to as overpopulation or overcrowding)<br>
            3. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives, unchanged, to the next generation<br>
            4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours will come to life<br>
